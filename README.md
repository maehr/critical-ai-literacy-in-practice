## About the Project

This research explores critical AI literacy in digital humanities practice through case studies from Swiss institutions. We demonstrate how scholars can engage with AI tools responsibly while maintaining academic integrity and ethical standards.

### Key Research Questions

- How can digital humanities scholars develop critical AI literacy?
- What frameworks guide responsible AI implementation in research?
- How do current DH projects in Switzerland use AI tools ethically?
- What lessons can we learn from existing practices?

### Core Findings

- **AI is pervasive** in academic research and requires critical engagement
- **Historical understanding** of AI development provides essential context
- **Critical AI literacy frameworks** can guide responsible implementation
- **Swiss DH projects** demonstrate practical approaches to ethical AI use

## Critical AI Literacy Framework

Our research identifies six key components of critical AI literacy for digital humanities scholars:

### 1. Technical Literacy

Understanding how AI systems work, their capabilities and limitations, particularly large language models and their training processes.

### 2. Epistemological Awareness

Questioning what counts as knowledge and how AI shapes knowledge production in scholarly research.

### 3. Ethical Evaluation

Considering consent, privacy, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted research workflows.

### 4. Social Impact Assessment

Examining power structures, equity issues, and broader implications of AI adoption in academia.

### 5. Practical Application

Developing workflows that maintain scholarly rigor while leveraging AI capabilities effectively.

### 6. Continuous Learning

Staying informed as AI technology evolves rapidly and adapting practices accordingly.

## Swiss Digital Humanities Projects Using AI

This research documents several innovative approaches to AI integration in Swiss DH projects:

### Re-Experiencing History with AI (University of Zurich)

The AIncient Studies Lab has developed an interactive platform for generating historically grounded visualizations of Classical antiquity using fine-tuned image and video generation models.

### Mini-Muse: Cultural Archive Access (SUPSI & ETH Library)

A pilot project exploring NLP and data visualization for exploratory access to digitized historical publications in the E-Periodica archive.

### Alt Text Generation (Stadt.Geschichte.Basel, University of Basel)

An open-source pipeline that enhances Dublin Core metadata by generating WCAG-compliant alt texts for historical sources and objects.

### Humanities Data Benchmark (RISE, University of Basel)

An open benchmark suite testing large language and multimodal models on humanities-relevant visual tasks, providing public leaderboards for model performance.

## Educational Initiatives

### University of Bern: Decoding Inequality

A critical examination of AI systems with focus on inequality and bias issues.

### University of Zurich: ChatGPT and Beyond

Interdisciplinary approaches to AI literacy combining practical skills with critical analysis.

## Getting Started

### For Most Users: Reproducible Setup with GitHub Codespaces

1. **[Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=open-research-data-template&template_owner=maehr)** for your project in a new repository on your GitHub account.

   <div align="center">
     <img src=".github/docs/assets/img_use.png" alt="Use the repository" style="width: 540px; margin: 1em 0;" />
   </div>

2. Click the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right of this repository.

3. Select the **‚ÄúCodespaces‚Äù** tab and click **‚ÄúCreate codespace on `main`‚Äù**.
   GitHub will now build a container that includes:
   - ‚úÖ Node.js (via `npm`)
   - ‚úÖ Python with `uv`
   - ‚úÖ R with `renv`
   - ‚úÖ Quarto

   <div align="center">
     <img src=".github/docs/assets/img_codespace.png" alt="Create Codespace" style="width: 540px; margin: 1em 0;" />
   </div>

4. Once the Codespace is ready, open a terminal and preview the documentation:

   ```bash
   uv run quarto preview
   ```

   <div align="center">
     <img src=".github/docs/assets/img_terminal.png" alt="Terminal window showing command" style="width: 540px; margin: 1em 0;" />
   </div>

> **Note:** All dependencies (Node.js, Python, R, Quarto) are pre-installed in the Codespace.

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
npm run prepare

# 2. Setup Python environment
uv sync

# 3. Setup R environment
Rscript -e 'install.packages("renv"); renv::restore()'

## Project Setup Checklist (for all users)

After creating your project from this template (either via Codespaces or local setup), complete the following steps to customize and finalize your project:

- [ ] **Enable GitHub Security Alerts**: Go to your repository's "Security" tab on GitHub and enable security alerts.
- [ ] **Protect the Main Branch**: In your repository settings on GitHub (under "Branches"), protect your `main` branch.
